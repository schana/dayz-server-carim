This server was created as a platform to develop an open source configuration tool for DayZ servers. Building a working economy and configuring mods takes time and effort, but with this tool, anyone should be able to stand up and modify a DayZ server with ease. All the configuration and utilities to generate it are available at https://github.com/schana/dayz-server-carim.

The discord is home to CarimBot (<https://github.com/schana/carim-discord-bot>), a bot that provides cross chat between the game and discord along with admin RCon commands for server owners.

Carim is also the platform for developing the following open source mods:
